        Eventually through a series of unsatisfactory tracking units, we decided
        that it would be more efficient to purpose build some for the company 
        and use those. From then on, my task was to use my current knowledge of tech
        to develop a working and reliable tracking system for their company vehicles."

        and then. Its end purpose is to be a way to take notes in any webbrowser 
        on any computer and organize them. When I say organize, I mean I want to 
        be able to write notes and the system take something like date and subject 
        and class and be able to tag it with specifics like if that day in math, 
        you reviewed laplace transforms, then you can tag the note group for that 
        day as laplace transforms. In the end, what if you have something like 
        \"test mode\" where you activate this when a test is coming up. It then 
        opens up a window asking for the chapters and respective subjects per 
        chapter that the test covers. This gives the application enough 
        information to group your notes intelligently, and then you just check 
        off what skills you feel you've mastered and the app hides them, cleaning 
        your workspace.",
